Mail Server(Emulator) works like browser based(GUI) email service but this
emulator works on Command Line Interface(CLI). All basic functionalities are
provided. In this project we are emulating an emailing service. You will create and
delete users, present them with their inbox, and send emails back and forth. This
project was done at end of 4th semester for the better understanding of arrays and
file structures. Most of the project is designed using modularity principles and
implemented user defined functions.
